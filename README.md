# Client component explanations
This section of the documentation gives a in depth description of each component file inside the client, as well as information on how to use them. \
Folder path: client/src/components

## Notebook.jsx
there are 3 crucial parts of notebook that anyone using the component should be aware of:
- blank space
   - the space on each page that is left empty, that will be filled in by the component calling notebook
- arrow buttons
   - two large arrows that the user can click to flip between pages
   - arrow keys and A/D keys will also allow the user to flip through pages
- page number
   - a number at the bottom of each page that displayed to the user the page that they are on

The following is what notebook.jsx looks like without any props being provided: \
![blank Notebook.jsx](/readmeImages/notebookBlank.png)

There are 3 props that notebook accepts when being called
- pageList
   - required prop
   - used to display any html that should appear inside the notebook
- parentPageNumber
   - optional prop
   - decides the value of the first page being provided to notebook
- requestNewPage
   - optional prop
   - a function that will be called in the event that the user tries to access a page that does not currently exist

### pageList - required prop
pageList is an array of JSON objects, each JSON object inside pageList represents and page that Notebook.jsx should be displaying. The array should look something like this:
```js
[
   { /*page one*/ },
   { /*page two*/ },
   { /*page three*/ }
   // add as many pages as you need
]
```

At any given time, Notebook.jsx will display up to two pages. A page that is being displayed will have its content shown in the gree box:\
![editable portion of Notebook.jsx](/readmeImages/notebookPageListVisableSquare.png)

There are two parts to each JSON object inside pageList:
- content
   - a react function that can be called in like any other component
   - contains all page content
- props
   - a JSON object
   - contains all data being passed from the component calling notebook to the component being referenced in this object

All JSON objects inside pageList should look like this:
```js
{
   // the content of the page you want notebook.jsx displaying
   content: ReactComponent,
   // any props the individual component needs to work properly
   props: {
      // you can change the name of the prop as you pass it to Notebook.jsx, however for simplicity the documentation will keep the prop names consistent
      propOne: propOne,
      propTwo: propTwo
      propThree: propThree
      // add as many props as you need
   }
}
```

this is all the information you need to understand how page list works, now the documentation will provide some example code.

#### example code (one page)
some simple code that demonstrate's how to use NoteBook.jsx to render a notebook with one page inside it

calling Notebook.jsx to only display one page should look like this:
```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import Notebook from "../components/Notebook";

// this is the main function that is being exported
// this is the function that will calls notebook
export default function MainFunction() {

   // create a use state for testing the component
   const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

   // create a function for testing the component
   function searchFunction() {
      console.log('searching database for:', search);
   }

   const pageList = [
      // JSON object for the page
      {
         content: PageOne,
         props: {
            // pass down the useState
            search: search, 
            setSearch: setSearch,
            //pass down the function
            searchFunction: searchFunction
         }
      }
   ];

   // call the Notebook and make sure to pass pageList 
   return <NoteBook pageList={pageList} />
}

// function containing the content of the page you want to display
function PageOne({ search, setSearch, submitSearch }) {
   // use the props being passed down 
   return (
      <div>
         <input
            value={search} 
            onChange={ (event) => { setSearch(event.target.value) } }
            placeholder='enter a value'
         />
         <button
            onClick={ () => { submitSearch() } } 
         >
            search database
         </button>
      </div>
   )
}
```
The following are the important portions of the code:
- there are two react components in this code
   - MainFunction - the parent function
   - PageOne - the child function
- pageList is defined inside the parent component, and has the child components are called inside the pageList array as an indexes content
- Variables and functions defined inside the mainPage component, can be used by the PageOne component, as long as they are passed down as props
- all actual html you want shown inside notebook is defined inside the child component

the resulting page should look like this: \
![notebook with only one page](./readmeImages/notebookWithOnePage.png)
and when the button is clicked a the console will log a message: \
![terminal message shown after button was clicked](./readmeImages/notebookWithOnePageAfterSubmit.png)

#### example code (three pages)
The main usefulness for Notebook.jsx is displaying multiple pages of information at once.

Using Notebook.jsx to display 3 pages should look something like this: \
```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import Notebook from "../components/Notebook";

// this is the main function that is being exported
// this is the function that will calls notebook
export default function MainFunction() {

   // create a use state for testing the component
   const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

   // create a function for testing the component
   function searchFunction() {
      console.log('searching database for:', search);
   }

   const pageList = [
      // JSON object for the first page
      {
         content: PageOne,
         props: {
            // pass down the useState
            search: search, 
            setSearch: setSearch,
            //pass down the function
            searchFunction: searchFunction
         }
      },
      // JSON object for the second page
      {
         content: PageTwo,
         // this page requires no props, so just pass an empty json object
         props: {}
      },
      // JSON object for the third page
      {
         content: PageThree,
         props: {
            text: "this is the third page"
         }
      }
   ];

   // call the Notebook and make sure to pass pageList 
   return <Notebook pageList={pageList} />
}

function PageOne({ search, setSearch, searchFunction }) {
   // use the props being passed down 
   return (
      <div>
         <input
            value={search} 
            onChange={ (event) => { setSearch(event.target.value) } }
            placeholder='enter a value'
         />
         <button
            onClick={ () => { searchFunction() } } 
         >
            search database
         </button>
      </div>
   )
}

function PageTwo() {
   // no props given by parent, so lets create our own variables

   // create useStates for testing the component
   const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');
   const [text, setText] = useState('');
   // create a function for testing the component
   function searchFunction() {
      setText(userInput);
   }

   return (
      <div>
         <input
            value={userInput} 
            onChange={ (event) => { setUserInput(event.target.value) } }
            placeholder='enter a value'
         />
         <button
            onClick={ () => { searchFunction() } }
         >
            Search value
         </button>
         <p>now searching for: {text}</p>
      </div>
   )
}

function PageThree({ text }) {
   // display the text given by parent through props
   return (
      <div>
         <h1>Third page</h1>
         <p>{text}</p>
      </div>
   )
}
```

The following are the important portions of the code:
- pageList now has 3 JSON objects, each representing one page
- as shown when adding pageTwo to pageList, if you don't want to assign any props to a page you can just set props to {}
